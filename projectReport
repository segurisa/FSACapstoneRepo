For our project, we attempted to mimic a small florist location needing to create a website that can achieve the following:

1. Handle current traffic and expected increased traffic for Valentine's Day
2. Monitor traffic and keep logs of all activity; suspicious or not
3. Set up an inventory that can hold all items currently in inventory and accomodate for new items
4. Can properly...
  a. Process items from inventory for purchase
  b. Create and place orders from purchases made
